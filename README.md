OpenKnit is a project that offers a new digital fabrication tool, an open-source knitting machine that can create ready-to-wear clothes from digital files. 

WARNING: this project is at an early stage of development, every piece of hardware and software is in beta version, testing and testing, if you're adventurer this is a place for you.  Let me know if interested in speeding up the progress and become a developer.
Currently working on making the machine fully automated, since some steps are still being handmade, reliability is not at its best.
