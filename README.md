OpenKnit is a project that offers a new digital fabrication tool, an open source knitting machine that can create ready to wear clothes from digital files. 
http://doknityourself.com is an online repository created for sharing clothes, by Takahiro Yamaguchi 

IMPORTANT: this project is in an early stage of development, every piece of hardware and software is in beta version, testing and testing, if you're adventurer this is a place for you :)  Let me know if interested in speeding up the progress and become a core developer.
Currently working on making the machine fully automated, since some steps are still being handmade (as seen on the video -link soon-), reliability is not at it’s best.


Documentation

In the SketchUp file you can find the whole machine, you can export parts for printing and check details for assembling, a bit rough I guess, working on that.
The Arduino file is the firmware for the machine, for Arduino Leonardo (since it has 5 interrupts)
Knitic is the software for operating the machine, by Mar Canet & Varvar Guljajeva at https://github.com/mcanet/knitic



SOON

all the .stl exports of every printable part. 

a step by step assembly manual.

a bill of materials with every single part, quantity-price-provider
